# HXXSPF

Haxe implementation of [XSPF](http://xspf.org/) ("spiff"), the XML format for sharing playlists.

* It is free and open -- No proprietary lock-in.
* It is portable -- You should be able to send a playlist to your friend and have it work.
* It is well-engineered -- Most playlist formats get the easy things wrong.


* Unlike M3U, XSPF is XML.
* Unlike SMIL, XSPF is simple.
* Unlike ASX, XSPF is open.
